# rl_book
Misc code associated with exercises in Sutton's 'Reinforcement Learning'.  Suitable environment
provided for conda in `envirnment.yml`

## Chapter 1 & Chapter 2

Hadn't started this repo at this point

### TODO

Go back and implement at least a bandit framework

## Chapter 3

Implemented MDP framework in a minimal-dependencies manner, with reusable abstractions for probability
distributions.  The only dependencies are `numpy` and `matplotlib` (the latter just to generate chart
results for the exercises)

### TODO

Should try porting to a probabilistic programming framework such as Pyro
